\begin{list}
  * \omega is the sample space 
  * \mathbb{P} is probability function

  \begin{lemma}
    \[
      1) Given a family of disjoint sets (A_i)_{i = 1,...,k}
      \P(\cup_{i = 1}^kA_i ) = \sum_{}^{}

    \]
  \end{lemma}
   
\end{block}



\begin{proof}[Proof Continuity from below]
 We proof continuity from above. By De Morgan's Law
 \bigcap_{n = 1}^ \infty A_n = (\cup n = 1 ^ infty A_n ^{c}) ^{c}
 \[
  P(\cap_{n = 1}^\infty A_n) = 

 \]
\end{proof}
